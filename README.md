# ** MODIFIED VERSION OF DX HUD WITH PRIORITY STATUS**

# ** DISCONTINUED / WON'T FIX **

I want to express my gratitude for the support during the development of dx_hud. However, I've decided to discontinue its development as my interests have shifted. I'm now focusing on my real job and life goals. Thank you all for the great journey.

Moving forward, I will consider merging only very small fixes directly into the repository as long as it exists. For any other substantial changes, I encourage you to fork the repository and proceed with the necessary modifications.

# dx_hud

dx_hud is a FiveM HUD for ox_core or ESX Legacy.

## Dependencies

- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)

This also requires a framework of your choice between ox_core and es_extended.
Note that if you are using ESX, you will also need esx_status and esx_basicneeds.

## Download & Installation

- Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/0xDEMXN/dx_hud/releases "Releases page") and download the latest release
- Place it inside the `resources` directory
- Add the resource to your `server.cfg` after dependencies to make sure it's started correctly at server startup:

```
ensure dx_hud
```

## Configuration

You can add these settings directly to your 'server.cfg', or add them to a separate file (i.e. hud.cfg) and call it with exec. **Convars must be set before starting dx_hud.**

The values below are defaults and should not be explicitly set unless changing the value.

``` yaml

# Seabelt system
setr hud:seatbelt false

setr hud:fuel false

# Vehicles speed: "imperial" or "metric"
setr hud:unitsystem "imperial"

# Radar mode: by default, the radar is only enabled while sitting on a vehicle.
# Set this to true to have it always enabled. This will also enable the map cycler.
setr hud:persistentRadar false

# Radar shape
setr hud:circleMap true

# Keys for map cycler and seatbelt
setr hud:cyclemapKey "Z"
setr hud:seatbeltKey "B"
